Data Challenge and proposed project

This is the repository for The Data Incubator for Jan 2020. I used the dataset of LendingClub Kaggle challenge to analyze whether a borrower is
likely to default ('Charged Off') vs Paying the loan in full.

I have also uploaded a python notebook for the data manipulation and programming questions in the first section of the challenge.
